"""Top-down proportional reconciliation (numpy port — phase 2, slice 1).

Makes PRIO-GRID-month (pgm) forecasts sum to their country-month (cm) total by
**top-down disaggregation using forecast proportions** (FPP3 terminology),
applied **per posterior draw**: within a draw, each grid cell keeps its relative
share and the cells are rescaled so they sum to that draw's country total. Zeros
stay zero; country totals are authoritative; the result is non-negative.

This is a *faithful, numpy-only* port of views-reporting's
``ForecastReconciler.reconcile_forecast`` (torch), migrated here because the
algorithm belongs in post-processing, not reporting (views-reporting issue #72).
It is intentionally the **same** method — a pragmatic per-draw approximation, not
principled joint probabilistic reconciliation. The upgrade to the latter is
tracked as **C-37** and is deliberately deferred until this port's parity with
the original is proven and the move is wired.

No torch, no pandas — numpy only.
