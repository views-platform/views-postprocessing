"""Reconcile a pgm `PredictionFrame` to cm country totals (epic #31, story #34).

The heart of the migration: for each `(time, country)`, scale that country's grid
cells so their per-draw sum matches the country forecast, using the parity-proven
leaf `reconcile_proportional` (PR #30). Grid rows are labelled by country with
views-frames `cross_level_align` — the sanctioned cm↔pgm primitive, which fails
loud if any grid row lacks a country (mirrors the original's "valid countries"
guard). De-mutated: returns a **new** pgm frame (C-184); the input is untouched.

numpy + views-frames only. The loop is over `(time, country)` groups (a small
number), not over rows; each group call is fully vectorised over cells × samples.
